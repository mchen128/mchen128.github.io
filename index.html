                <p>Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Matthew Chen, and I'm currently working as an electrical test engineer in Houston, TX.</p>
                <p>I graduated from school with a degree in electrical engineering, but I'm branching out to learn software skills. I'm hoping to one day build cool tools and apps that look and feel good to use.</p>
                <p>I enjoy spending time with my fiance and playing video games with my friendsand family. I also play drums on the side!</p>
