Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Matthew Chen, and I'm currently working
as an electrical test engineer in Houston, TX. 

I graduated from school with a degree in electrical engineering, but I'm 
branching out to learn software skills. I'm hoping to one day build 
cool tools and apps that look and feel good to use.

I enjoy spending time with my fiance and playing video games with my friends
and family. I also play drums on the side at my church!
